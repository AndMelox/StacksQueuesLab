Warehouse Chain Inventory
This repository contains an application developed as part of the Programming III lab, designed to manage the inventory of a warehouse chain. The project uses data structures like stacks and queues to efficiently manage products in the warehouses, representing the collections with linked lists.

View product by code: Retrieves detailed information of a specific product using its code.
Count different products: Displays the number of different products registered in the inventory.
Calculate total inventory value: Shows the total value of all products stored in the warehouse.
Record a product sale: Reduces the quantity of a sold product, updating the inventory.
For the warehouse chain:
Add new warehouses: Allows the creation and registration of a new warehouse along with its address.
Calculate total inventory value for the chain: Displays the combined total value of the inventory across all registered warehouses.
